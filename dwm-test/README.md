I have included my personal keybindings (`config.h`) here for reference; feel free to delete this to start fresh with default configuration (from `config.def.h`). Most notable I guess is binding `rotatestack` and `cyclelayouts` to the mouse wheel which can be rather convenient when having many windows in the stack. I also mapped middle-click to move a window to master (`zoom`) rather than toggling floating mode which you enable anyway when dragging a window.
